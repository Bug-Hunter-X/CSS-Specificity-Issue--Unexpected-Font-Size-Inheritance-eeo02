The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.container {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.container .special p {
  font-size: 14px; /* This is unexpected */
}
```

The expectation is that the paragraph within the `special` class would inherit the `18px` font size from its parent, `.container p`. However, due to CSS specificity rules, the `14px` declaration in `.container .special p` overrides the inherited value, creating an unexpected outcome.
